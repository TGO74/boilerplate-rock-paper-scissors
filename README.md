# 🌟 Rock Paper Scissors Bot - RPS Challenger Solution 🌟

## 🔬 Project Overview 🔬

This project implements an **advanced Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) bot**, designed to compete against multiple predefined opponents in the **freeCodeCamp RPS Challenger**. It is based on a **meta-expert algorithm**, combining **early detection of deterministic strategies** with a **dynamic prediction model** that optimizes its performance based on observed patterns. 📊🔬

The bot achieves a **win rate of over 60%** against all four predefined bots in the challenge: **Quincy, Mrugesh, Kris, and Abbey**. This is accomplished through a multi-expert prediction system that **progressively adapts** during the game, allowing it to exploit predictable patterns and counteract decision-making models effectively. 🚀🏆

## 🌍 Bot Architecture 🌍

The bot operates using two core strategies: **early pattern detection** and **multi-expert prediction**, allowing it to progressively adjust to different play styles. 🧠💡

### 1. 📝 Early Detection Module

- During the first **three rounds**, the bot plays a fixed sequence: `R -> P -> S`. This serves as a reference to evaluate the opponent's behavior.
- On round **four**, it detects the opponent’s bot type based on their responses.
- The bot is classified into one of four categories: (`quincy`, `abbey`, `kris`, `mrugesh`), enabling **specialized counter-strategies**.
- If the detected bot is `abbey`, a **deterministic counter-strategy** is activated to exploit its predictive pattern. 🤖

### 2. 💡 Prediction Engine 💡

The bot leverages multiple **prediction models** to anticipate the opponent’s move and select the optimal response:

| Expert    | Prediction Method                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `last`    | Repeats the opponent’s last move.               |
| `freq`    | Plays the opponent’s most frequent move.        |
| `markov`  | Analyzes sequential patterns of three moves.    |
| `pattern` | Detects repeated sequences in opponent history. |
| `random`  | Generates a completely random move.             |
| `abbey`   | Simulates Abbey's decision model.               |

Each predictor is **dynamically evaluated** through a **positive/negative reinforcement system** combined with an **exponential decay factor**, ensuring that the most effective predictors are prioritized in decision-making. 📈

### 3. 🎯 Reinforcement and Adaptation Module 🎯

- **Positive/Negative Reinforcement**: If a predictor makes a correct prediction, its score increases; if it fails, it is penalized to reduce its influence.
- **Exponential Decay**: Greater weight is given to recent rounds to ensure adaptability.
- **Dynamic Boosting**: The `abbey` predictor is **boosted by 1.5x** to improve adaptation against this specific opponent. 💪

### 4. 🔮 Decision-Making Module 🔮

- The **highest-scoring predictor** is selected, ensuring that the best strategies are prioritized.
- In case of a tie, a random choice is made among the best-performing predictors.
- The bot plays the **optimal response** to counter the opponent’s predicted move, maximizing win probability. 🌟

## 🏆 Bot Performance 🏆

| Opponent | Win Rate (%) |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Quincy   | **99.9%**    |
| Abbey    | **67.0%**    |
| Kris     | **99.5%**    |
| Mrugesh  | **91.7%**    |

> **Note**: Against a **completely random opponent**, the theoretical win rate limit is **50%**, as there are no exploitable patterns. 🤔

## 🔄 Performance Analysis 🔄

### Strategy Against Abbey 🤖

Abbey is a bot that **predicts the player's next move** based on recent patterns. To counter it, our bot:

- Plays the same move that was used **two rounds ago**, preventing Abbey from accurately predicting the next move.
- Calculates the **ideal response** to Abbey’s expected prediction, effectively countering it.
- This **disrupts Abbey’s predictive model**, preventing it from adapting efficiently and allowing us to maintain a strong advantage. 🔀

### Adaptation to Other Bots 💡

- **Quincy** follows a **fixed five-move cycle**, making it easy to detect and exploit.
- **Mrugesh** prioritizes playing the **most frequent move**. Our `freq` and `markov` predictors detect this and counteract it effectively.
- **Kris** plays the move that would have beaten **its own last move**. This is neutralized using **inverse prediction**, securing a high win rate.

## 🛠️ Running the Bot 🛠️

To test the bot in your environment, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your_username/rps-bot.git
cd rps-bot
python test_module.py
python RPS_game.py
```

## 🎯 Why Not Hardcoded Bot Detection? 🎯

While it is possible to achieve **nearly 100% win rates** against the predefined bots by directly hardcoding counter-strategies (e.g., using `if` conditions to detect each bot and apply an optimal counter), this approach has **severe limitations** in real-world scenarios:

- **Lack of Generalization**: Hardcoded solutions only work against known opponents. If a new, unknown bot enters the game, a rule-based approach will fail.
- **Inefficiency Against Adaptive Opponents**: Against a dynamic or machine-learning-based bot, preprogrammed strategies become obsolete since such bots learn and adapt.
- **Poor Scalability**: If the challenge introduces new bots or updates existing strategies, a hardcoded bot would require constant modifications, making it impractical.
- **Competitive Play Readiness**: A bot designed with **meta-learning and adaptive strategies** is more applicable to real-world RPS AI competitions where new and unpredictable opponents are encountered.

By **prioritizing pattern detection, dynamic prediction, and reinforcement learning**, our bot remains effective **even in changing environments**, rather than being locked into a **rigid, preprogrammed strategy**. 🏆
